Hi, 
Intel Aero Ready To Fly (RTF) drone is very good for developers to start drone programming for any drone programmer and new drone enthusiastic guy and have zero drone programming experience like me. Once I got my drone deliver I realized , I can't start working upfront as it need accessories to support programming on it which Intel don't ship. It took me a while to find out the right accessories for the programmer to must have if you want to work on Intel RTF. 
I am here listing all required accesories one by one which we need to work upon intel aero drone.

1) Power Wall adapter 
We can't rely on battery power to work longer on drone which can support maximum 15 minutes of power. We should have one power wall adapter. Power wall adapter is very crucial, so I created a seperate video regarding which wall adapter we should use. Please click on image to open video link.

2) OTG USB cable, required to connect drone to USB hub If you are buying new OTG cable it is always preferable to USB 3.0 cable for fast access.

4) USB mouse, to work on RTF, mouse is essential , USB wired or bluetooth wifi mouse anything will be fine.
Need to add seperate image..

5) USB keyboard.

Need seperate Image..

6) USB hub, Intel RTF does not come with multiple port to support USB mouse and keyboard we will need one USB hub.
Need seperate Image...

7) HDMI Monitor , screen is required to have clear view of any development and flashing ubuntu on RTF
