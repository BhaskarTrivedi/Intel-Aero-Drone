Intel Aero Ready To Fly (RTF) drone is very good for developers to start drone programming for any drone programmer and new drone enthusiastic guy and have zero drone programming experience like me. Once I got my drone deliver I realized , I can't start working upfront as it need accessories to support programming on it which Intel don't ship. It took me a while to find out the right accessories for the programmer to must have if you want to work on Intel RTF. 
I created this repository to return back to community whatever I learned from free source. I have to visit multiple place to figure it out what accesories we need? How to install operating system, accessing the camera to writing my own code to fly it. I have created this repository to share whatever I am doing so if any new drone ethusiastic guy go for Intel-Aero . He can refer my repository to do basic setup and basic programming
