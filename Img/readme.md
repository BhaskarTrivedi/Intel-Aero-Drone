Hi, Intel Aero Ready To Fly (RTF) drone is very good for developers to start drone programming for any drone programmer and new drone enthusiastic guy and have zero drone programming experience like me. Once i got my drone deliver I realized , I can't start working upfront as it need accessories to support programming on it which Intel don't ship. It took me a while to find out the right accessories for the programmer to must have if you want to work on Intel RTF.
