Hi, 
Intel Aero Ready To Fly (RTF) drone is very good for developers to start drone programming for any drone programmer and new drone enthusiastic guy and have zero drone programming experience like me. Once I got my drone deliver I realized , I can't start working upfront as it need accessories to support programming on it which Intel don't ship. It took me a while to find out the right accessories for the programmer to must have if you want to work on Intel RTF. 
I am here listing all required accesories one by one which we need to work upon intel aero drone.

1) Power Wall adapter 
We can't rely on battery power to work longer on drone which can support maximum 15 minutes of power. We should have one power wall adapter. Power wall adapter is very crucial, so I created a seperate video regarding which wall adapter we should use. Please click on image to open video link.
