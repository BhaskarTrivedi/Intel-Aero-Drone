This is my first try with drone. At this point of time I don't have any knowledge with drone or robot programming but as we all know robot and drone is future and it is coming a bit earlier this time to us so it's good if we start learning it right now.

Considering this in mind, I have order Intel aero Ready to Fly drone(RFD) , which is designed for professional developer. It can be used for application development and drone learning. We can flash linux onto it and use it for development.

I have made unboxing video and sharing it you guys......

Very soon.. I will share how to fly this drone untill then keep in touch....
