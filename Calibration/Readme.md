After installing ubuntu and intel aero maintenance tool next thing to follow calibration before trying to fly your drone using RC remote. 
I perform basic radio, accelerometer and compass calibration.
1)	Start your drone
2)	Connect to Intel Aero Ready To Fly drone wifi (Normally name start with Aero -XXXXXXXX , XXXXX is your drone MAC ID)
3)	Start QGroundControl
4)	Go to setting 
5)	Select Radio
